Demo software to visualize, calibrate and process Kinect output
http://nicolas.burrus.name/index.php/Research/KinectRgbDemoV6

This software was partly developed in the RoboticsLab
http://roboticslab.uc3m.es and aims at providing a simple toolkit to
start playing with Kinect data.

The code is based on the freenect library http://openkinect.org, 
the OpenNI library http://openni.org, OpenCV http://opencv.willowgarage.com,
and PCL http://pointclouds.org.

The demos are based on a library called nestk. The library itself is
easy to integrate to an existing project using cmake: just copy the
nestk folder as a subfolder of your project and you should be able to
start working with Kinect data. You can get a tutorial to get started
there: http://nicolas.burrus.name/index.php/Research/KinectUseNestk .

ROADMAP
=======

* New demos!
* GPU acceleration using OpenCL
